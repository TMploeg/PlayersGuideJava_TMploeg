<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="37">You open your eyes and find yourself face down on the beach of a large island, the waves crashing on the<br>
shore not far off. A voice nearby calls out, “Hey, you! You’re finally awake!” You sit up and look around.<br>
Somehow, opening your IDE has pulled you into the Mysterious Realms of Java (not related to the (uncopyrighted) name of a certain island in Indonesia), a strange land where<br>
it appears that you can use Java programming to solve problems. The man comes closer, examining you.<br>
“Are you okay? Can you speak?” Creating and running a “Hello, World!” program seems like a good way<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="67">The man, who tells you his name is Ritlin, asks you to follow him over to a few of his friends, fishing on<br>
the dock. “This one here has the makings of a Programmer!” Ritlin says. The group looks at you with eyes<br>
widening and mouths agape. Ritlin turns back to you and continues, “I haven’t seen nor heard tell of<br>
anybody who can wield that power in a million clock cycles of the CPU. Nobody has been able to do that<br>
since the Uncoded One showed up in these lands.” He describes the shadowy and mysterious Uncoded<br>
One, an evil power that rots programs and perhaps even the world itself. The Uncoded One’s presence<br>
has prevented anybody from wielding the power of programming, the only thing that might be able to<br>
stop it. Yet somehow, you have been able to grab hold of this power anyway. Ritlin’s companions suddenly<br>
seem doubtful. “Can you show them what you showed me? Use some of that Programming of yours to<br>
make a program? Maybe something with more than one statement in it?”</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="77" data-line-end="85">These lands have not seen Programming in a long time due to the blight of the Uncoded One. Even old<br>
programs are now crumbling to bits. Your skills with Programming are only fledgling now, but you can<br>
still make a difference in these people’s lives. Maybe someday soon, your skills will have grown strong<br>
enough to take on the Uncoded One directly. But for now, you decide to do what you can to help.<br>
In the nearby city of Consolas, food is running short.Telim has a magic oven that can produce bread from<br>
thin air. He is willing to share, but Telim is an Excelian, and Excelians love paperwork; they demand it for<br>

numbers in the dirt.<br>
“What is all of that writing for?” you ask.<br>
“I’m just trying to calculate the area of all of my triangles. They sell by their size. The bigger they are, the<br>
more they are worth! But I have many triangles on my farm, and the math gets tricky, and I sometimes<br>
make mistakes. Taking a tiny triangle to town thinking you’re going to get 100 gold, only to be told it’s<br>
only worth three, is not fun! If only I had a program that could help me….” Suddenly, P-Thag looks at you<br>
with fresh eyes. “Wait just a moment. You have the look of a Programmer about you. Can you help me<br>
write a program that will compute the areas for me, so I can quit worrying about math mistakes and get<br>

more often than not, the number of eggs is not evenly divisible among the sisters, and everybody knows<br>
you cannot split a chocolate egg into pieces without ruining it. The arguments have grown more heated<br>
over time. The town is tired of hearing the four sisters complain, and Chandra, the town’s Arbiter, has<br>
finally come up with a plan everybody can agree to. All four sisters get an equal number of chocolate<br>
eggs every day, and the remainder is fed to their pet duckbear. All that is left is to have some skilled<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="221" data-line-end="233">The Uncoded One has begun an assault on the city of Consolas; the<br>
situation is dire. From a moving airship called the Manticore,<br>
massive fireballs capable of destroying city blocks are being<br>
catapulted into the city.<br>
The city is arranged in blocks, numbered like a chessboard. You can assume its defenders are smart, so they can also move outside the city to say row -1 if needed.<br>
The city’s only defense is a movable magical barrier, operated by a<br>
squad of four that can protect a single city block by putting<br>
themselves in each of the target’s four adjacent blocks, as shown in<br>
the picture to the right.<br>
For example, to protect the city block at (Row 6, Column 5), the<br>
crew deploys themselves to (Row 6, Column 4), (Row 5, Column 5),<br>
(Row 6, Column 6), and (Row 7, Column 5). (you may want to make a sketch of the situation on a piece of paper)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="234" data-line-end="238">The good news is that if we can compute the deployment locations fast enough, the crew can be<br>
deployed around the target in time to prevent catastrophic damage to the city for as long as the siege<br>
lasts. The City of Consolas needs a program to tell the squad where to deploy, given the anticipated<br>
target. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="has-line-data" data-line-start="239" data-line-end="247">Target Row? 6

most of it, except one piece that requires the steady hand of a Programmer. It is the part that makes the<br>
clock tick and tock. Numbers flow into the clock to make it go, and if the number is even, the clock’s<br>
pendulum should tick to the left; if the number is odd, the pendulum should tock to the right. Only a<br>

down The Uncoded One’s airship. “If we’re going to be able to track this thing down,” she says, “we need<br>
you to make us a program that can help us home in on a location.” She lays out a plan for a program to<br>
help with the hunt. One user, representing the airship pilot, picks a number between 0 and 100. Another<br>
user, the hunter, will then attempt to guess the number. The program will tell the hunter that they<br>
guessed correctly or that the number was too high or low. The program repeats until the hunter guesses<br>
the number correctly. Mylara claims, “If we can build this program, we can use what we learn to build a<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="481" data-line-end="487">The Uncoded One’s airship, the Manticore, has begun an all-out attack on the city of Consolas. It must be<br>
destroyed, or the city will fall. Only by combining Mylara’s prototype, Skorin’s cannon, and your<br>
programming skills will you have a chance to win this fight. You must build a program that allows one<br>
user—the pilot of the Manticore—to enter the airship’s range from the city and a second user—the city’s<br>
defenses—to attempt to find what distance the airship is at and destroy it before it can lay waste to the<br>
town.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="488" data-line-end="496">The first user begins by secretly establishing how far the Manticore is from the city, in the range 0 to 100.<br>
The program then allows a second player to repeatedly attempt to destroy the airship by picking the<br>
range to target until either the city of Consolas or the Manticore is destroyed. In each attempt, the player<br>
is told if they overshot (too far), fell short (not far enough), or hit the Manticore. The damage dealt to the<br>
Manticore depends on the turn number. For most turns, 1 point of damage is dealt. But if the turn number<br>
is a multiple of 3, a fire blast deals 3 points of damage; a multiple of 5, an electric blast deals 3 points of<br>
damage, and if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, a mighty fire-electric blast deals 10 points of damage. The<br>
Manticore is destroyed after taking 10 points of damage.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="497" data-line-end="499">However, if the Manticore survives a turn, it will deal a guaranteed 1 point of damage to the city of<br>
Consolas. The city can only take 15 points of damage before being annihilated.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="590" data-line-end="601">As you move through the village of Enumerant, you notice a short, cloaked figure following you. Not<br>
being one to enjoy a mysterious figure tailing you, you seize a moment to confront the figure. “Don’t be<br>
alarmed!” she says. “I am Simula. They are saying you’re a Programmer. Is this true?” You answer in the<br>
affirmative, and Simula’s eyes widen. “If you are truly a Programmer, you will be able to help me. Follow<br>
me.” She leads you to a backstreet and into a dimly lit hovel. She hands you a small, locked chest. “We<br>
haven’t seen any Programmers in these lands in a long time. And especially not ones that can craft types.<br>
If you are a True Programmer, you will want what is in that chest. And if you are a True Programmer, I<br>
will gladly give it to you to aid you in your quest.”<br>
The chest is a small box you can hold in your hand. The lid can be open, closed (but unlocked), or locked.<br>
You’d normally be able to go between these states, opening, closing, locking, and unlocking the box, but<br>
the box is broken.You need to create a program with an enumeration to recreate this locking mechanism.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="602" data-line-end="607">The box can be in three states:<br>
if the box is in the OPEN state, you can close it, and it becomes CLOSED<br>
if the box is in the CLOSED state, you can open it, and it becomes OPEN<br>
if the box is in the CLOSED state, you can lock it, and it becomes LOCKED<br>
if the box is in the LOCKED state, you can unlock it, and it becomes CLOSED</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="608" data-line-end="610">Nothing happens if you attempt an impossible action in the current state, like opening a locked box.<br>
The program below shows what using this might look like:</p>

you saw a glowing emerald gem inside. You don’t know what it is, but it seems important. Also in the box<br>
were three vials of powder labeled HOT, SALTY, and SWEET.<br>
“Finally! I can make soup again!” Simula says. She casually tosses the small glowing gem to you but is<br>
wholly focused on the powders. “You stick around and help me make soup with your programming skills,<br>
and I’ll tell you what that gem does.”<br>
She pulls out a cookpot, knocks the clutter off the table with a quick sweep of her arm, and begins<br>
cooking. She says, “I’m the best soup maker in town, and you’re in for a treat. I’ve got recipes for soup,<br>
stew, and gumbo. I’ve got mushrooms, chicken, carrots, and potatoes for ingredients. And thanks to you<br>
getting that box open, I’ve got seasonings again! Spicy, salty, and sweet seasoning. Pick a recipe, an<br>

determine how much he should sell them for.“A tiny fragment of my soul goes into each arrow; I care<br>
not for the money; I just need to be able to recoup my costs and get food on the table,” he says.<br>
Each arrow has three parts: the arrowhead (steel, wood, or obsidian),the shaft (a length between 60 and<br>
100 cm long), and the fletching (plastic, turkey feathers, or goose feathers).<br>
His costs are as follows: For arrowheads, steel costs 10 gold, wood costs 3 gold, and obsidian costs 5 gold.<br>
For fletching, plastic costs 10 gold, turkey feathers cost 5 gold, and goose feathers cost 3 gold. For the<br>
shaft, the price depends on the length: 0.05 gold per centimeter.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="808" data-line-end="812">The fifth and final pedestal describes a class that represents a concept more abstract than the first four:<br>
a password validator. You must create a class that can determine if a password is valid (meets the rules<br>
defined for a legitimate password). The pedestal initially doesn’t describe any rules, but as you brush the<br>
dust off the pedestal, it vibrates for a moment, and the following rules appear:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="812" data-line-end="813">Passwords must be at least 6 letters long and no more than 13 letters long.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="813" data-line-end="814">Passwords must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="814" data-line-end="820">Passwords cannot contain a capital T or an ampersand (&amp;) because Ingelmar in IT has decreed it.<br>
That last rule seems random, and you wonder if the pedestal is just tormenting you with obscure rules.<br>
You ponder for a moment about how to decide if a character is uppercase, lowercase, or a number, but<br>

More text engraved on the pedestal describes what you recognize as the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, stating<br>
that in ancient times, inhabitants of the land would use this as a Battle of Wits to determine the outcome<br>
of political strife. Instead of fighting wars, they would battle it out in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.<br>

darkness. You can see nothing, but you can hear and smell your way through the caverns to find the<br>
Fountain of Objects, restore it, and escape to the exit.<br>
The cavern is full of dangers. Bottomless pits and monsters lurk in the caverns, placed here by the<br>
Uncoded One to prevent you from restoring the Fountain of Objects and the land to its former glory.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1189" data-line-end="1200">The Fountain of Objects game is a 2D grid-based world full of rooms. Most rooms are empty, but a few<br>
are unique rooms. One room is the cavern entrance. Another is the fountain room, containing the<br>
Fountain of Objects.<br>
The player moves through the cavern system one room at a time to find the Fountain of Objects. They<br>
activate it and then return to the entrance room. If they do this without falling into a pit, they win the<br>
game.<br>
Unnatural darkness pervades the caverns, preventing both natural and human-made light. The player<br>
must navigate the caverns in the dark, relying on their sense of smell and hearing to determine what<br>
room they are in and what dangers lurk in nearby rooms.<br>
This challenge serves as the basis for the other challenges in this level. It must be completed before the<br>
others can be started. The requirements of this game are listed below.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1201" data-line-end="1202"><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1203" data-line-end="1205">The world consists of a grid of rooms, where each room can be referenced by its row and column. Initially, the grid consists of 4 x 4 is 16 rooms.<br>
North is up, east is right, south is down, and west is left:</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1205" data-line-end="1209">The game’s flow works like this: The player is told what they can sense in the dark (see, hear, smell).<br>
Then the player gets a chance to perform some action by typing it in. Their chosen action is resolved<br>
(the player moves, state of things in the game changes, checking for a win or a loss, etc.). Then the<br>
loop repeats.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1209" data-line-end="1210">Most rooms are empty rooms, and there is nothing to sense.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1210" data-line-end="1213">The player is in one of the rooms and can move between them by typing commands like the<br>
following: “move north”, “move south”, “move east”, and “move west”. The player should not be able<br>
to move past the end of the map.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1213" data-line-end="1216">The room at (Row=0, Column=0) is the cavern entrance (and exit). The player should start here.The<br>
player can sense light coming from outside the cavern when in this room. (“You see light in this room<br>
coming from outside the cavern. This is the entrance.”)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1216" data-line-end="1223">The room at (Row=0, Column=2) is the fountain room, containing the Fountain of Objects itself. The<br>
Fountain can be either enabled or disabled. The player can hear the fountain but hears different<br>
things depending on if it is on or not. (“You hear water dripping in this room. The Fountain of Objects<br>
is here!” or “You hear the rushing waters from the Fountain of Objects. It has been reactivated!”) The<br>
fountain is off initially. In the fountain room, the player can type “enable fountain” to enable it. If the<br>
player is not in the fountain room and runs this, there should be no effect, and the player should be<br>
told so.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1223" data-line-end="1225">The player wins by moving to the fountain room, enabling the Fountain of Objects, and moving back<br>
to the cavern entrance. If the player is in the entrance and the fountain is on, the player wins.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1225" data-line-end="1228">Use different colors to display the different types of text in the console window. For example,<br>
narrative items (intro, ending, etc.) may be magenta, descriptive text in white, input from the user<br>
in cyan, text describing entrance light in yellow, messages about the fountain in blue.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1228" data-line-end="1229">An example of what the program might look like is shown below:</li>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1287" data-line-end="1296">The Uncoded One knows the significance of the Fountain of Objects and has placed minions in the<br>
caverns to defend it. One of these is the maelstrom—a sentient, malevolent wind. Encountering a<br>
maelstrom does not result in instant death, but entering a room containing a maelstrom causes the<br>
player to be swept away to another room. The maelstrom also moves to a new location. If the player is<br>
moved to another dangerous location, such as a pit, that room’s effects will happen upon landing in that<br>
room.<br>
A player can hear the growling and groaning of a maelstrom from a neighboring room (including<br>
diagonals), which gives them a clue to be careful.<br>
Modify the basic Fountain of Objects game in the ways below to add maelstroms to the game.</p>

gem—the Heart of Object-Oriented Programming—out of your pack and hold it in the palm of your<br>
hand, contemplating the journey you have taken to get here.You slide your hand along the Fountain until<br>
you find a small recess, just big enough for the Heart to be placed. You slide the green gem in, and the<br>
fountain immediately comes to life. The water in the fountain, previously still, suddenly begins churning<br>
and overflowing onto the ground around you. You make a hasty escape to the cavern entrance.<br>
Within minutes, water rushes out the entrance and through a thousand other holes in the mountainside,<br>
collecting into a raging waterfall down into the valley below. Within days, the newly restored River of<br>
Objects will flow to the sea, restoring its life-giving power to the entire island.<br>
With the River of Objects flowing again, the land will become bountiful with objects of every class,<br>

your final destination.<br>
Scattered across the islands are the ancient Medallions of Code, made of nearly indestructible binarium,<br>
each of which grants True Programmers additional powers. Each medallion is guarded by the islands’<br>
inhabitants, who serve as protectors and stewards. Without being Programmers, they are unable to use<br>
them themselves. By visiting these islands, you can acquire these medallions, gain the powers they<br>
provide, and maybe even enlist these guardians to help in the final assault at the Uncoded One’s domain.<br>
Yet time is short; every clock cycle you delay gives the Uncoded One more time to reign destruction and<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1617" data-line-end="1622">The island of Io has a long-running tradition that was destroyed when the Uncoded One arrived. The<br>
inhabitants of Io would compete over a long period of time to see who could press the most keys on the<br>
keyboard. But the Uncoded One’s arrival destroyed the island’s ability to use the Medallion of Files, and<br>
the historic competitions spanning days, weeks, and months have become impossible. As a True<br>
Programmer, you can use the Medallion of Files to bring back these long-running games to the island.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1623" data-line-end="1624"><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1627" data-line-end="1628">Add 1 point to their score for every character they type. Hint: it appears the Ioans of yore did not accept anything less than a Holy Whole Line that was ended with an Enter key press, so the characters will only be counted after the Enter key has been pressed. The enter key does not count towards the score itself, however, as one should not overuse sacred keys…</li>

generated, between 0 and 9. Occasionally, the stream generates the same number more than once in a<br>
row. A repeat number like this is significant—an omen of good things to come. Unfortunately, since the<br>
Uncoded One’s arrival, Threadians haven’t been able to monitor the stream while it produces numbers.<br>
Either the stream generates numbers while nobody watches, or they watch while the stream produces<br>
no numbers. The Threadians offer you the Medallion of Threads willingly and ask you to use it to make<br>
both possible at the same time. Build a program to generate numbers while simultaneously allowing a<br>

hard. His ancestors have been the stewards of the Asynchronous Medallion, yet Awat uses it as a food<br>
dish for his cat. “A thousand monoids with a thousand random generators will also eventually produce<br>
‘hello world’!” he claims. Indeed, they could, but you know it would take a while. With tasks, you can allow<br>
a human to pick a word and randomly generate the word asynchronously. Doing this will show Awat how<br>
long it will take to randomly generate the words “hello” and “world,” convincing him that a Programmer’s<br>
skills mean something.</p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1723" data-line-end="1728">Make a class that implements <code>Callable&lt;Integer&gt;</code>, add a constructor that takes a string. Its call method should take the string’s length and<br>
generate an equal number of random characters. It is okay to assume all words only use lowercase<br>
letters. One way to randomly generate a lowercase letter is (char)(‘a’ + random.nextInt(26)).<br>
This method should loop until it randomly generates the target word, counting the required<br>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1780" data-line-end="1782">Before a character takes their turn, the game should report to the user whose turn it is. For example,<br>
“It is SKELETON’s turn….”</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1782" data-line-end="1785">The only action the game needs to support at this point is the action of doing nothing (skipping a<br>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1785" data-line-end="1787">The game must run a battle with a single skeleton in both the hero and the monster party. At this<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1818" data-line-end="1829">The previous two challenges have had the characters taking turns directly. But instead of characters<br>
deciding actions, the player controlling the character’s team should pick the action for each character.<br>
Eventually, there will be several action types to choose from (do nothing, attack, use item, etc.). There<br>
will also be multiple player types (computer/AI and human input from the console window). A player is<br>
responsible for picking an action for each character in their party. The game should ask the players to<br>
choose the action rather than asking the characters to act for themselves.<br>
For now, the only action type will be a do-nothing action, and the only player type will be a computer<br>
player.<br>
This challenge does not demand that you add new externally visible capabilities but make any needed<br>
changes to allow the game to work as described above, with players choosing actions instead of<br>
characters. If you are confident your design already supports this, claim the XP now and move on.</p>

crunch.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1858" data-line-end="1862">The program must be capable of representing an attack action, our second action type. An attack<br>
action must represent which attack is being used and the target of the attack. When this action runs,<br>
it should state the attacker, the attack, and the target. For example: “TOG used PUNCH on<br>
SKELETON.”</li>

random.Next(2) will generate a 0 or 1 with equal probability.</li>

the action types, with implementations like DoNothingAction and AttackAction. I have a<br>
method that creates the list of menu items, and it produces a new MenuItem instance for each<br>
choice. The code that draws the menu iterates through the MenuItem instances and displays them<br>
with a number. After getting the number, I find the right MenuItem, extract the Action, and return<br>
it. That means I create many Action objects that don’t get used, but it is a system that is easy to<br>

<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start="2135" data-line-end="2136"><a id="Challenge_85_Making_it_Yours_2135"></a>Challenge 85: Making it Yours</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2136" data-line-end="2142">This is perhaps the most exciting challenge: the one where you get to do whatever you want to the game.<br>
This challenge is also repeatable. If you’d rather make four of your own enhancements instead of the<br>
other challenges listed above, go for it.<br>
Use your best judgment when awarding yourself XP, comparing what you’ve chosen with the other<br>
challenges here.<br>
The possibilities are limitless, but here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2142" data-line-end="2145">More heroes. You could add Mylara and Skorin, whose gear (or standard attack) is the Cannon of<br>
Consolas, which deals 1 damage most of the time, 2 damage every multiple of 3 or 5, and 5 damage<br>
every multiple of 3 and 5. (This adds some continuity from the early part of the book!)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2145" data-line-end="2146">Add more item types. Maybe Simula’s soup is a full heal, restoring HP to its maximum.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2146" data-line-end="2147">Add offensive attack modifiers.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2147" data-line-end="2148">Let characters equip more than one piece of gear.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2148" data-line-end="2150">Let gear provide offensive and defensive attack modifiers. (A Binary Helm that reduces all damage<br>
done by 1 when equipped, for example.)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2150" data-line-end="2151">Experience Points. As heroes defeat monsters, give them XP to track their accomplishments.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2151" data-line-end="2152">More monster types.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2152" data-line-end="2154">Add attack side effects, which allow an attack to run other logic when an attack happens. Maybe a<br>
Shadow Octopoid with a grapple attack that has a chance of stealing equipped gear.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2154" data-line-end="2155">Load levels from a file instead of hardcoding them in the game.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2155" data-line-end="2157">Display a small indicator in the status display that gives you a warning if a character is close to death.<br>
Perhaps a yellow [!] if the character is under 25% and a red [!] if the character is under 10%.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2157" data-line-end="2160">Allow characters to taunt their enemies with messages like the Uncoded One saying &lt;&lt;THE<br>
UNRAVELLING OF ALL THINGS IS INEVITABLE&gt;&gt; and a skeleton saying, “We will repel your<br>
spineless assault!”</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2160" data-line-end="2162">Allow characters to have temporary effects applied to them. For example, a poison effect that deals<br>
1 damage per turn for three turns.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2162" data-line-end="2164">Strip out all Player’s Guide-specific elements and re-theme the game into your own creation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start="2164" data-line-end="2165"><a id="Challenge_86_Restoring_Balance_2164"></a>Challenge 86: Restoring Balance</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2165" data-line-end="2169">Depending on the challenges you completed, the game is likely not very balanced anymore. Either the<br>
heroes or the monsters win all the time. Without changing logic and mechanics, adjust things like potion<br>
counts, attack strengths and probabilities, the number of battles and monsters they contain to produce<br>
a version of the game where if you play wisely, you are likely to win, but if you play poorly, you will lose.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2170" data-line-end="2171"><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2172" data-line-end="2174">Tweak aspects of the game (no need to write new logic, just change parameters and character counts,<br>
etc.) until you have something challenging and fun.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2174" data-line-end="2176">Do what you can to ensure that The Uncoded One feels formidable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start="2176" data-line-end="2177"><a id="Narrative_10_The_True_Programmer_2176"></a>Narrative 10: The True Programmer</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2177" data-line-end="2193">You slice your sword through the smoky form of the Uncoded One for the last time. It begins to<br>
disintegrate, binary streams flowing out of it until it bursts apart in a dazzling blue light. You have done<br>
it. You have defeated the Uncoded One.<br>
You step out of the cave’s entrance and back onto the slopes of the volcano as ash falls like snow from<br>
the sky. Your allies have turned the tide of the battle against the Uncoded One’s minions, and they surge<br>
through their final ranks as the remnants begin to scatter in retreat. You and your allies have saved these<br>
realms from the grasp of the Uncoded One.<br>
As the sun sets, alighting the ash cloud in a crimson glow, you meet up with your old friends to celebrate<br>
with a feast. They’re all there. Vin Fletcher with his arrows. Simula with her soups. Mylara and Skorin,<br>
with an improved cannon that helped break the Uncoded One’s lines during the battle. Everyone else<br>
that you met as you voyaged through the Realms.<br>
As the feast begins to wind down—and after you have had three full bowls of stew—Simula speaks to<br>
you. “You have shown that you are, without question, a True Programmer. To me. To us. To the Uncoded<br>
One. The power of Programming can return to these islands once again. But tell me, brave Programmer,<br>
what will you do next?”<br>
You take a slow, deep breath as you ponder the question before you respond.</p>
